My skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java and Kotlin. Now I focus on learning React. My goal is to develop full response web apps and multi-tab websides. I was previously working as computers networks assembler and now as network engineer. For me learning of programming is like a hobby. I like coding in frontend becaouse I can see immediately effect of my work. Next great technology for me is programming language Ruby. Everything I learning myself. My interesting is traveling, watching good serials as well as movie and reading about new technology.
