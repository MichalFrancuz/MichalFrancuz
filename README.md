### Hi there! 👋

I'm Michał. I graduated Computer Science in WSB University (Bachelor) <a href="https://wsb.edu.pl/uczelnia/aktualnosci/akademia-wsb-na-podium-rankingu-szkol-wyzszych-perspektywy-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Akademia WSB</a>. My skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java and Kotlin. Now I focus on learning React. My goal is to develop full response web apps and multi-tab websides. I was previously working as computers networks assembler and now as network engineer. For me learning of programming is like a hobby. I like coding in frontend becaouse I can see immediately effect of my work. Next great technology for me is programming language Ruby. Everything I learning myself. My interesting is traveling, watching good serials as well as movie and reading about new technology.
